Strontium Submergence

Description

You are a submarine commander, captaining a new top secret nuclear powered submarine. This new power source provides almost unlimited energy, but it is a little *unstable*, and somewhat prone to exploding if shaken too much.

If the coolant reaches unstable levels, you'll almost certinaly die. So don't get shot too often.
